      <Description>There are several and distinct Game Objects you can use in the scene. 
The Empty object can be used as a container - it's not the only function. 
Think of it like an invisible layer, whose children are grouped inside and move along with it. 
Start by adding one of those in the Scene - name it Container. In order to do that, either right mouse click in a Scene’s Hierarchy Object or press the Add New button at its top. </Description>
